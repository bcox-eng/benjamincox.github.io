Project: High-Torque 20:1 Helical Gear Reduction Drive

Designed and fabricated a custom two-stage reduction gearbox to convert high-speed DC motor input (10,000+ RPM) into high-torque output for robotic actuation. The project served as a targeted exercise to improve CAD modeling, Design for Manufacturing (DFM), and Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) skills.

Parametric CAD Using Onshape, I modeled a complex assembly where the housing geometry is parametrically linked to a helical gear train. I utilized a specialized gear tool to generate Module 1.5 profiles with a 20° helix angle, prioritizing smooth power transmission and noise reduction.

DFM: To manage the axial forces generated by helical gears, I seated bearings on a solid 5mm floor enclosed by reinforced, friction-fitted slots. This ensures the housing remains rigid.

GD&T: I toleranced the case to account for the physical constraints of FDM printing. Since the printer follows a center-line path and extrudes material roughly 0.2mm over both sides of that line, I implemented a consistent 0.2mm offset across all critical features (motor and bearing mounts, shaft clearances). This successfully compensated for material overflow and shrinkage, ensuring precise fitment across all mating components.

DFA: To ensure a robust and serviceable enclosure, I integrated brass heat-set inserts throughout the housing, secured with M4 bolts. This approach allows for high clamp loads and repeatable, wear-free maintenance cycles, providing a much more durable mechanical connection than threading directly into the 3D-printed plastic.

The project resulted in a fully operational 20:1 reduction drive that effectively manages high-velocity inputs and complex axial forces within a compact, 3D-printed form factor. The final assembly achieved perfect mechanical alignment, producing a quiet, high-torque output suitable for high-load robotic applications.
